### Tips

- table filter on datepicker mode, value clears after select and close popup. also, what should be the cells actual
  value if we want to datepicker filter works properly?
- check components label that WON't be 100px due to css flex issues (maybe good to change labelWidth to minWidth).

### Feature

- fix below issue: 
  1- change sidebarType
  2- responsive until mobile view
  3- change size to desktop view
  4- the sidebarType is reset to its default value 
- replace css colors with variables and make theme colors configurable
- create a configService to dynamically configure theme,rtl,ripple,labelPos,... (should itself use themeService).
- fix AOS bug
- add bootstrap 5
- use gap instead of margin left and right
