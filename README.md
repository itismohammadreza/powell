- search for TODO comments in project.
- table filter on datepicker mode, value clears after select and close popup. also, what should be the cells actual
  value if we want to datepicker filter works properly?
- check components label that WON't be 100px due to css flex issues (maybe good to change labelWidth to minWidth).
