  value if we want to datepicker filter works properly?

### Feature
- replace css colors with variables and make theme colors configurable

- change NgConfig model by extending primeng model
- change config handler just like what do in react project
- create datepicker base that locale based on shamsi and gregorian datepicker and use it in gregorian.datepicker and jalali.datepicker components for managing error and label etc.
- remove filled property and replace with inputStyle (in global config) and variant (in per component)
- add rtl to bottomSheet and handle header
- rename disableConfigChangeEffect to followConfig
- add powellConfig in appConfig interface and control powell config from there
- implement config change (and read from config) in dialog component
