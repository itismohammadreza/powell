### Tips

- table filter on datepicker mode, value clears after select and close popup. also, what should be the cells actual
  value if we want to datepicker filter works properly?
- check components label that WON't be 100px due to css flex issues (maybe good to change labelWidth to minWidth).

### Feature

- [ ] **all** : set label align-self to top in some components.
- [ ] **table** : complete paginator and rowIndex
- [ ] **map** : fix blinking on map pan.
