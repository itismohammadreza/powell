### TIPS

- table filter on datepicker mode, value clears after select and close popup. also, what should be the cells actual
  value if we want to datepicker filter works properly?
- check components label that WON't be 100px due to css flex issues (maybe good to change labelWidth to minWidth).

### Feature

- [ ] **all** - handle rtl direction in panels and dialogs when append them to body.
- [ ] **dialogForm**
  - add hook support in config (just like angular formly to implement cascade mode).

### New

- [ ] **table**
  - implement pagination configurable
  - implement showRowIndex
- [ ] **jalaliDatepicker** - implement component.
- [ ] **whiteboard** - implement component.
